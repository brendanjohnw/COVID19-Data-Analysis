This project is about extracting data from structured and unstructured data, manipulating and analyzing data to help transform raw data like .csv files and 
unstructured text files into meaningful information like text similarity as well as visualizations in the form of graphs and tabulations. This would be
a basis for data mining and a method to help people interpret unsorted and unstructured data more soundly.

Dependencies:

- Week 2,3,4 lectures and slides by Pauline Lin (Porter Stemming, TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity)
- Week 1,2,4 workshop worksheets (visualization, regular expressions, python pandas)
- nltk library documentation: https://www.nltk.org/py-modindex.html
- pandas library documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/index.html#api
- COMP10001 Grok worksheets (for recap on python basics)
