This project is about extracting data from structured and unstructured data, manipulating and analyzing data to help transform raw data like .csv files and 
unstructured text files into meaningful information like text similarity values as well as visualizations in the form of graphs and tabulations. This is the
basis for data mining and a method to help people interpret unsorted and unstructured data more soundly and easily.

The data sets used:
Our Word in Data's covid-19 word data set
Cricket articles.
